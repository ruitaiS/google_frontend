!add the share icon to the top-right of the logo >> it keeps nudging the logo off center

!add the search icon into the search bar >> this should be working but idk why it doesn't

!tweak spacing of various elements
    search buttons are off-center
    footbar text is not vertically centered
    navbar text is awkwardly spaced / uses weird padding

add mouseover text

style cleanup - not sure I'm using divs / id's / classes correctly; need to edit "grammar" as far as which rules are being applied & which ones are being overridden, eliminate redundancies

Remember to actually do these changes rather than simply leave as-is; gotta start taking pride in my work & doing things as well as I know how.
