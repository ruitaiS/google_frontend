## [Google Frontend](https://ruitais.github.io/google_frontend/)

This is a recreation of the Google Search homepage that I made as part of the Odin Project's self-paced web-dev program. It was my first major foray into HTML and CSS, and as such I'm planning to keep it as-is for posterity, rather than go back and clean it up.

To be honest it was super intimidating at first, after looking at the complexity of the homepage itself and also at how nice some of the other student examples were. Up until now all I've really done is academic coding, which focused a lot more on algorithms and theory; I'd never actually tried to *make* anything.

Eventually I did get into the flow of it. It felt kind of like when you dump out all 10,000 pieces of a jigsaw puzzle and you have no clue where to start, but then you get a couple pieces connected, and later a couple little islands begin to form, and eventually it all starts coming together.

Since I was really new at this, I took sort of a "when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail" approach, relying really heavily on flexbox and padding to nudge everything into the right place. Hence there's some really weird padding numbers, and probably quite a bit of repeated code and/or other stylistic no-nos.

There were some things that I couldn't quite figure out, like the alignment of the microphone icon within the clickable anchor area - it's just a few pixels high and it actually really bugged me at the time, but I had to accept that I just didn't know enough at that point to do anything other than to be annoyed. There were also some aspects of the page behavior (found in the todo file) that I never got around to adding. I'd reached a point of diminishing returns continuing to nudge pixels around rather than continuing to learn (and Google kept changing their homepage logo and text!!), so I just let it be.

Overall I really enjoyed working on it. It felt good making things look nice and aligning things properly with the real version (even though I admittedly got pretty obsessive about it), and it really got the ball rolling for me again in terms of starting to code again.
