<a href="https://ruitais.github.io/webpage/">This</a> is a recreation of the Google Search homepage that I made as part of the Odin Project's self-paced web-dev program.

I'm still pretty new at web design so I took a bit of a "when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail" approach, relying really heavily on flexbox and padding to nudge everything into the right place. Hence there's some really weird padding numbers, and probably quite a bit of repeated code / other stylistic no-nos.

Still there are some things that I couldn't quite figure out, like the alignment of the microphone icon within the clickable anchor area - it's just a few pixels high and it's actually really really bugging me, but I've accepted that I just don't know enough at this point to do anything other than to be annoyed.

Lastly there's some aspects of the page behavior (found in the todo file) that I never got around to adding. I feel that I've reached a point of diminishing returns continuing to work on this project (and Google keeps changing their homepage logo and text!!), so I'll just leave it as is for now.
